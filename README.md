__GOP__ variable need to change, if installed different location. Replace `$GOP/` in script.
## js,css comment:
2 flavor, fancy and -not files.
- __fancy__ one combines copy js and link into one, but need to use vimlike browser plugin to perform task. I'm not sure how to fix it. Use bookmark.svg at __line 48__.
  
- __-not__ one sepearate copy and link to different element, css may need some improvement. __(script default)__
